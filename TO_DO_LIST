COMMAND :
	❌	CONNECT :
		CONNECT <target server> [<port> [<remote server>]] (RFC 1459)
    	CONNECT <target server> <port> [<remote server>] (RFC 2812)
			Instructs the server <remote server> (or the current server, if <remote server> is omitted) to connect to <target server> on port <port>.[3][4] This command should only be available to IRC operators. Defined in RFC 1459; the <port> parameter became mandatory in RFC 2812.
	❌	DIE :

			Instructs the server to shut down.[5] This command may only be issued by IRC server operators. Defined in RFC 2812.
	❌	INVITE : 
    	INVITE <nickname> <channel>
			Invites <nickname> to the channel <channel>.[9] <channel> does not have to exist, but if it does, only members of the channel are allowed to invite other clients. If the channel mode i is set, only channel operators may invite other clients. Defined in RFC 1459. 
	❌	ISON : 
	    ISON <nicknames>
			Queries the server to see if the clients in the space-separated list <nicknames> are currently on the network.[10] The server returns only the nicknames that are on the network in a space-separated list. If none of the clients are on the network the server returns an empty list. Defined in RFC 1459. 
	❌	JOIN : 
	    JOIN <channels> [<keys>]
			Makes the client join the channels in the comma-separated list <channels>, specifying the passwords, if needed, in the comma-separated list <keys>.[11] If the channel(s) do not exist then they will be created. Defined in RFC 1459.
	❌	KICK :
	    KICK <channel> <client> :[<message>]
			Forcibly removes <client> from <channel>.[12] This command may only be issued by channel operators. Defined in RFC 1459.

			Forcibly removes <client> from the network.[13] This command may only be issued by IRC operators. Defined in RFC 1459. 
	❌	LIST : 
	    LIST [<channels> [<server>]]
			Lists all channels on the server.[15] If the comma-separated list <channels> is given, it will return the channel topics. If <server> is given, the command will be forwarded to <server> for evaluation. Defined in RFC 1459. 
	❌	NICK : 
	    NICK <nickname> [<hopcount>] (RFC 1459)
	    NICK <nickname> (RFC 2812)
			Allows a client to change their IRC nickname. Hopcount is for use between servers to specify how far away a nickname is from its home server.[23][24] Defined in RFC 1459; the optional <hopcount> parameter was removed in RFC 2812.

	    OPER <username> <password>
			Authenticates a user as an IRC operator on that server/network.[26] Defined in RFC 1459.
